# Origin notice

The initial HBServe codebase was extracted from the MIT-licensed HBFSim working
tree based on commit `b44a7960ea44e20252aa6c8e758e8f9ed2d7a4b5`. It was renamed,
made independently installable, and stripped of production evidence and local
experiment history for this repository.

HBServe retains the original HBFSim copyright notice in `LICENSE`.

The unified fixed-window frontend and shared client incorporate HBFSim commit
`70c3fd5` (serving/window frontend unification). This standalone port preserves
HBServe's package name, public model schema, and external-simulator interface.
The 70B descriptor preserves the original per-output-channel W8 scale and
embedding storage assumptions through the public model ledger. Paper-specific
analysis runners, production evidence, and local experiment history are not
included.
