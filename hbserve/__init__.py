"""HBServe: one workload frontend for closed-loop serving and fixed windows.

Request path: catalog descriptor -> request source -> token-budgeted mixed
iterations with paged KV -> placement-independent object DAG -> object-class
placement (weights by tier, hot KV in HBM, cold KV in HBF or external) ->
persistent HBFSim session, with roofline compute by default.

The package deliberately separates request/model semantics from the mapped
memory protocol.  ``HBServeCompiler`` creates placement-independent
object accesses; ``HBServePlacement`` is the only layer allowed to turn those
objects into HBM, HBF, or external-memory transactions.

``hbserve.windows`` supplies matched, deterministic memory-only windows for
controlled topology comparisons without request scheduling or compute timing.
